My project will visual demonstrate the results of a wearable heartrate monitor. 

Summary
For my final project I have built a wearable heart rate monitor which displays results on a screen. 
The heart rate monitor will be placed inside of an athletic shirt so that athletes results will be displayed
in live time as they are working out. This will help coaches get a better understanding of how their athletes 
are preferoming. The display will show a graph with spikes in heart rate. 

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.
The project will be responsive to the envirment in the sense that it is responsive to the human body and 
how it preforms in different conditions. 

Component Parts
The components of my project are the shirt, the semsor, and this desplay.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.
